# Language Lab

Welcome to the *Language Lab*, where we prod and poke at language models to see if we can get them to do anything useful or at least mildly entertaining.

## Contribution

Join me in my futile attempt to keep up with all of the advancements in AI research, safety and alignment, adversarial strategies, and so on.

Really though, the goal is just to play around and have fun.

Whether you're a seasoned expert, curious bystander, or one of my Python scripts that become self-aware while I wasn't looking &mdash; I welcome your contributions, questions, issue reports, pull requests, and so on.
